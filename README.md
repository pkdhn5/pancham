Problem Statement
Create a IMDB.com like website with basic CRUD and movie listing using C# (Asp.NET MVC / Asp.NET
Core). We would like to have the following entities in the application.
Actors
- Name
- Sex
- DOB
- Bio
Movies
- Name
- Year of release
- Plot
- Poster (image)
Producers
- Name
- Sex
- DOB
- Bio
Relationships
● Actor can act in multiple movies
● Movie can have multiple actors
● Movie has only one producer
● Producer can produce multiple movies
Application specifics (minimum requirements)
1. Screen to list all movies with Name, Year of release, Producer and all Actors of that movie
2. Screen to ‘add’ a new movie with the necessary fields with existing actors and producers. If the user
wants to add new ‘Actors’ and ‘Producers’ while creating the movie which are not present in the
database then he should be able to do so while being on the same screen.
3. ‘Listing’ screen should allow user to click on ‘Edit’ and edit all the details of the movie and save it
would be a nice to do thing.
Hints and Tips
1. Focus on database design; we are fanatic about Normal Forms.
2. We are always on the lookout for best practices. Design/Styling/CSS is not critical; functionality is.
3. Define your own rules for validation; use common sense - also please make a note of the validations
that you have added
4. Use of upcoming JS frameworks like Knockout / Vue / React / Angular to surprise us.
5. Use Docker / ASP.NET Core and ‘WOW’ us!
